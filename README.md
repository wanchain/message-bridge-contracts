# Wanchain Message Bridge (WMB)

Wanchain Message Bridge (WMB) is a decentralized messaging protocol that allows messages to be transmitted between different blockchain networks, including Wanchain and other networks.

The protocol is implemented through the Wanchain Message Bridge smart contracts, which enable the transmission of messages between different chains.

## WMB Gateway

The WMB Gateway is a smart contract that acts as an intermediary between the Wanchain Message Bridge and the external blockchain networks. It provides a secure and efficient mechanism for transferring messages between the different networks. 

The WMB Gateway supports both blocking and non-blocking operation modes. In blocking mode, the channel is blocked until the target contract call succeeds or times out. In non-blocking mode, failed transactions are recorded and do not block subsequent transaction execution. 

## WMB App

WMB App is a smart contract that can be inherited by third-party DApps to interact with the WMB Gateway. It provides a customizable interface for interacting with the WMB Gateway and handling incoming messages.
